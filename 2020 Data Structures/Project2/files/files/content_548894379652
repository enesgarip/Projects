Pros:Probably the best picture in any class or price range. Analog stereo audio out jacks.   Cons:Minimal OTA channel features. No S-video in.   The Bottom Line: Like it alot but set needs better tuner features for Over the Air broadcast channels.
This is my first LCD wide screen TV. I picked this Sony out of the line up because of the obvious and clearly superior picture over any other brand in the size class. I love the picture but I am very disappointed with the tuner capabilities of this set. I was expecting much better channel surfing features.   Not a TV to buy if you watch mainly over the air broadcast signals. Especially if your using an outdoor antenna setup with a rotator. The set lacks these basic (necessary in my opinion) features. A quick and easy to access guide to scanned in OTA channel list. (You must add them manually to a Favorites guide) A look ahead OTA channel guide. On screen OTA channel browsing info. A signal strength meter for OTA channels. A way to locate and select a specific individual OTA channel to add or to tweak antenna position to. After all how much could it cost to include these common features even a cheap digital converter box has ? So for old fashioned rural antenna users the only way you might fully enjoy using this set is if you split your antenna signal to a good full feature converter box and run that in to one of the video inputs and use that as your viewing guide and signal strength indicator then toggle back to the built in TV tuner to watch the truly superior HD of the Sony Bravia. Gets to be a multi-tasking remote control juggling act that really shouldn’t be necessary. As far as all the complaints people have about the sound, it is just not that bad and what do they expect any way. When has any TV had quality sound ? You have always had to run the sound thru a good audio system to get top quality sound. A great and not common feature of the set is analog stereo audio out RCA jacks.
