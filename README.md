  This file contains the CSE projects of a student in Marmara University. Course names and the year of the course that I took is added to each filename. Also all projects have PDF files that explains the project and details.

* 2019 Operating Systems

  This file contains operating systems projects. These projects was done by a group of two students. [@mustafahakkoz](https://github.com/mustafahakkoz) was my group member.
  
  
  
* Java&JavaFX Term Project

  This project is a puzzle game. The project file contains the codes of the game using Java and JavaFX framework. In addition, this project also was done by two students. [@mferoglu](https://github.com/mferoglu) was my group member.

  

* 2019 Digital Logic Design

  This project contains a CPU design. All details about the project is in that file. The project was done by a group of three students. My group members were [@veysioz](https://github.com/veysioz) and M.Adem Evren Demirkuş.

  

* 2020 Microprocessors
  
  For this project, we design a CPU in logisim and in verilog. Then, we test the projects with FPGA kit. The details of the projects are included in related file. Also, this project was done by a group of two students. [@caglasen](https://github.com/caglasen) was my group member.
  
  
  
* 2020 Computer Organization
  
  This project folder contains two projects. In the first project, we implement some procedures in MIPS assembly language. It has three questions and a menu. We test our code in SPIM simulator. In the second project, we extend the MIPS single-cycle implementation by adding new instructions. These instruction list is given in the project report. These two project was done by a group of two students. [@mferoglu](https://github.com/mferoglu) was my group member.
  
  
  
* 2020 Object-Oriented Software Design

  In this project, we implement a labelling mechanism in object-oriented and iterative manner with Java. Also in the second project, we analyse the poll reports of the Zoom classes and these analysis gives us an output about attendance or the success rate of a student in the polls. The project was done by a group of 7 students. The project and the related files about the project is [here](https://github.com/enesgarip/CSE3063F20P1_GRP19 )
  
  
  
* 2020 Computer Networks

  This project contains the implementation of Multi-threading HTTP Web Server and Proxy Server in Java.  The project was done by a group of two students. Abdullah Gülçür was my group member.

  

* 2021 Analysis of Algorithms

  In the first project of this lecture, we analysed the performance of the sorting algorithms. After reviewing the results, we made a report to explain how changes occurs between sorting algorithms. In the second project, we tried to implement an algorithm for Multi-constraint Knapsack Problem.  For both project, my group members were [@veysioz](https://github.com/veysioz) and [@AGoktugylmz](https://github.com/AGoktugylmz).

  

- 2021 Information Systems Security

  This project folder contains two projects about cryptography. In first project, we tried to implement a java program for encryption and decryption of a text and also an image. In the second project, we implemented a server in java that users can register to the system and upload a photo and get notifications about other user's uploading's. All the details about the project is in the related folder such as reports and pdf of the project that explains the project. In both of the project, my group members were  [@mikailTorun](https://github.com/mikailTorun) and Mert İsmail Eği.

  

Others are individual projects. 

The Projects file will be updated when a new project is arrived.
