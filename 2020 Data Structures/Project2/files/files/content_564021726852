Pros:Cheap and you don't need to buy a computer monitor. Cons:The stand in the back doesn't detach well so watch it if your moving.
Dude this TV rocks!! Not only does it work as a tv but you can hook it up to your computer and wamo a 26 in computer monitor!!! This is awesome for college dorms and such if your looking to save space and you don't want a "giant tablet" (those new all in one computers are only good for casual use not for gaming or heavey use). So long as you don't mind not watching TV while doing your homework (a travesty I know) its a great 2 for one. On a note for the start up screen you might see like half the image missing (you can change this with the remote don't worry) but its only on the start up screen and some games. This shouldn't affect normal use.
