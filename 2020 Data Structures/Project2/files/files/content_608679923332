Pros:Excellent picture and sound. When it works. Cons:DVD player will not play or read some dvd's and will freeze up on most
I purchased this product to use in my truck, my laptop wouldn't play DVDs anymore so I got this unit. I have had nothing but problems with the DVD player since I bought it. The unit won't read some DVDs and will freeze in the middle of the movie on the rest.  It might just be my unit, but be wary if you are purchasing for DVD use only. Amount Paid (US$): 250.00
