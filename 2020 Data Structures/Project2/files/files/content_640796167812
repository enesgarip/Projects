Pros:Pros: 32 inches, flatscreen, affordable, LG, HDMI&USB ports Cons:Cons: The sound quality.
I have not had the best times with my LG 32LN541C Television. I get annoyed because i have to have the volume turned up almost to a 100 on the television in order for me and my children to hear it. Other than that it is a great tv to purchase. But i would not recomend for the living room of your house. I bought this product because my television stoped working and this was the cheapest LG tv they had at my local store. I love that i purchased the tv for a fair price and that it has a HDMI port and a USB port. Like i said i hate the sound quality in the tv.
