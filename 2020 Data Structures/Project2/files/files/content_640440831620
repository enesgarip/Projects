On my wedding my father gifted me with Samsung UN60EH6000 60" 1080p HD LED LCD Television. It was the best gift for me as I am a house wife and I am free most of the time. This LCD is becoming my best companion. Its picture quality is fabulous and the channels of cable are also crystal clear on it. It hang it on my wall and has enhanced the beauty of my bed room. It has many functions and its sound quality is also very good. Me and my husband has started watching movies at our home instead of cinema. Watching movies on Samsung UN60EH6000 60" 1080p HD LED LCD Television is a great experience. It has also usb port and when we want to watch any video we transfer it into usb device and watch it on this LCD. Our entire family love to watch our wedding video on LCD. If you have this at home then there is no need to spend in expensive stereo systems. Its price is also very affordable anybody can invest it. It is also very easy to connect DVD player with it and children can also play games on it with their play station as well.
