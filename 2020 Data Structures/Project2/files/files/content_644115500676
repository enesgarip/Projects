Pros:Easy navigation, good quality sound, quality resolution. Cons:Not too great remote. The Bottom Line: I would buy the television again because it meets my needs and is easy for someone not technologically savvy.
After searching high and low for a simple television set, my eyes set on the Vizio. The picture resolution is pretty good compared to the 52” Samsung that needed upgrading after years of usage. The set-up is easily navigated using the on-side television buttons. The sound quality is great! I find a steady 32 set volume is wonderful to get the full sound, but around 22 works as well. The television can go higher than 50 in volume! Also, I wanted a way to connect my Youtube to the television so I could watch clips. My Xbox 360 was easily hooked up to the TV and Youtube was quickly downloaded. It has AV, component, and other hook-ups for virtually anyone with any device! Has a stand that comes with it or you can wall mount it (I use the stand). Comes with a power chord as well. The only downside to this beautiful technology is that the remote dies quickly and is not very responsive when it is not dead. I found myself replacing the batteries many times to try to get the buttons to work properly! After I found out the batteries were not the issue, most times, then it just seemed to be a cheap remote that the television came with. The television was also surprisingly light considering the size! All in all, I am happy with the opportunities this TV offers.
