Pros:2 HDMI Ports, USB port, the normal cables, HD, and great sound! Cons:Only con is i wish i got a bigger one!! The Bottom Line: I strongly recommend this TV! Amazing, sound, ease of use, and overall quality! 
Bought this TV about two years ago, and haven't had a single problem! Looks great, sounds great, and i love the features like plugging my computer up to it! It has a convienient USB slot for phone charging, two HDMI slots for all your needs! Of course it has the traditional yellow, white, and red cables. The best TV i've yet to have. I recommend it to all of my friends and family, hasn't been a single problem, the quality has never gone down, it's always an amazing experience once i turn it on. I do recommend getting a larger one though! With my previous TV a brand i won't name, after about a few months the picture quality seemed to slowly get worse, HD was no longer HD. With my vizio as I said after 2 years the quality is still picture perfect! Also when using the RGB cable to display my computer on to my screen and a two way audio cord, the results were magnificent, I expected the picture to look dull or hazy but i was completely wrong. Streamed videos, and netflix and the quality was amazing. Got an HD quality picture with out and HDMI cable, or a service such as apple TV. GET THIS TV!!
