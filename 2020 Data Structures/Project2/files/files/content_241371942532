Pros:When it worked, the picture quality was good. Cons:The television broke, and the "Sony" customer service is terrible.
We bought the television in April, and we were satisfied with the product. The television broke in early May. The repair people came to our home two weeks later to fix it, and it wouldn't turn on after they left. The repair people came back two weeks later and said the picture tube was shot. Sony refused to give us a new Television, and two months later we are still waiting for a refurbished television that has been apparently been "lost" in shipping for a month. Every time I talk with a representative, they give me a "run-around" and never give me an answer as to when we will get a television. I am beyond frustrated with the "Sony" company, and I am ready to just buy a television from another company. If the customer service cannot be any better than this, they do not deserve to be in business.
