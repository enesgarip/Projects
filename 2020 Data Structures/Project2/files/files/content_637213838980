Pros:smart tv, stand, easy set up, easy to assemble Cons:none that I can think of The Bottom Line: I would absolutely recommend this to a buyer looking for the latest and newest small sized TV.
Buying the Vizio Smart TV HD LED LCD Internet TV was one of the better decisions I have made since I can remember.  I bought this product because I needed a new TV and was recommended this one by one of the employee’s at the store who was honest and said that he wished he had purchased one for himself instead of the one he did buy.  So that was what convinced me to buy one for myself.  At first I was skeptical of the tilt that it had with the strange stand but the way it is set up in my room the window is across from it and the tilt actually helps minimize the glare you normally get from light.  There was some assembly required but I kid you not a monkey could do it without directions.  The way the stand is you do need to have a surface that is deep enough to fit it but that really should not be a deal breaker.  I actually use the SmartTV features way more than expected.  If someone were to ask me I would say to really consider this TV because for the price you are getting a pretty amazing TV.
