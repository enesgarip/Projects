Pros:Very big with great picture quality. Cons:Complicated interface and remote. The Bottom Line: Bottom line, this tv's picture quality is unmatched as said by CNET. The best picture I have ever seen in person.
Let me get right to the point; this Samsung tv was the best tv they had to choose from at Best Buy, Sears and Frys Electronics. I searched for days for a television set that could double as my xbox monitor and triple as my computer moniter. Once I found this Samsung I knew it was the one, although starting at $2579 is kinda high. It has outstanding overall picture quality from everything to Call of Duty: Black Ops to National Geographic Wildlife. The black level preformance and picture quality was so high CNET gave it 5 stars and said "it was the most accurate picture quality on a TV we have ever reviewed." Now if that doesnt sell you maybe this will. Its a staggering 64" long which means you can be across the street and still see the picture perfectly. It comes with a video game input which makes games even more fun and it also comes with a computer hookup so you can have you computer, xbox, and blueray all working off the same moniter, which is something I find highly convenient. The only gripe I have about this tv is that the interface that it comes with is just as confusing and cluttered and their multi colored remote. I had the earlier Samsung version of this tv and the interface and remote were much easier to navigate. Big if youre looking for a big screen with great quality look no further.
