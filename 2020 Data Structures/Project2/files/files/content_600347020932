Pros:Low price, Easy set up, Great picture Cons:There is actually nothing negative to say about this product.
I bought the  Sceptre X320BV-HD 32" LCD beacause I needed a good TV at a low price. It's actually everything that I expected from it and much more.  It has a vey bright screen and vey clear picture. I don't think that you can find such a good tv at such a low price.
