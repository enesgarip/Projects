Pros:Great picture quality Can't beat the price Tons of features Cons:Weak factory speakers Short range on the remote The Bottom Line: I would highly recommend buying this TV. Don't be afraid of the brand.
When deciding which TV to buy for our newly added family room I promised myself I would only buy a big name brand. After doing tons of research and looking at a mind boggling amount of reviews I changed my mind. I wound up purchasing this Sceptre 42" LCD TV and I am not disappointed. I could not beat the price compared to the other "name" brands. I purchaced this back in March of 2012 and paid full price of around $550, however now you can find them on sale around $350-400. Our new family room is very bright and sunny but the picture on the Sceptre is oh so bright and has several brightness settings. The overall picture quality has been great however the standard built in speakers are a bit weak but acceptable. I added a surround sound system to enhance the sound. The remote signal is a bit weak, you have to get within 8 feet or so to use it. I have tried different batteries with no improvement. The TV has loads of outputs and inputs for all your gaming, video and sound needs. I have had no problems at all in the year that I have had it.    Amount Paid (US$): 550
